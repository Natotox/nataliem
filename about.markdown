My name is Natalie Mills. I am the eldest of four siblings and I was born and raised in Dominica. I've attended and completed: TC Sunbeam (Preschool), Convent Prepatory School (Primary School), and Convent High School. I am currently attending Dominica State College where I major in Computer Science.

My dream job is to be a Robotics Programmer, I'm not surprised seeing that, since small, I've always liked experimenting and creating. My goal with being a Robotics Programmer is to 1. Create an automated system to aid in farming, and 2. Create a therapist-type robot that helps people throughout their daily lives.
