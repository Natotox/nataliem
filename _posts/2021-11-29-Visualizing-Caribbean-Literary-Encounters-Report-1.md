<p>Since we've been presented with this project on the 11th of November, I've only done three sessions; however, I've discovered several things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, my thoughts on this project have been along the lines of:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>There is a large increase in the amount of literature created in and about the Caribbean from a certain point in time.</li><li>There must've been an event that caused this.</li><li>This increase happened around/in the 1900s.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This led to the question:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>What caused the sharp increase of literature created in and about the Caribbean from the 1900s onwards?</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also thought:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I wasn't aware of the amount of Caribbean literature available.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I began to reflect:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>What type of books do I read?</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I then realized that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I don't read Caribbean literature for recreational purposes.</li><li>Most, if not, then all the Caribbean books I've read were because of school requirements; which, is not much.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since I was assigned the period of 1861 - 1900, I noticed that more books are being created and published as it got closer to 1900. I was able to notice this quickly because of the way I was searching for books. Instead of searching '1861 - 1900,' I began searching for each year from 1861 to 1900 which gave me more results. It was because of this search method that I realized that with each year I searched up, more results came up. I also noticed that a vast number of these books were written by foreign authors.</p>
