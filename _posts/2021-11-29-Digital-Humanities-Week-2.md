<ul><li>In digital humanities, what we think we will build and what we build are often quite different.</li><li>When we produce a work of scholarship in whatever form, Jerome&nbsp;McGann reminds us that “to make anything is also to make a speculative foray into a concealed but wished for unknown.”</li><li>The work that we make,&nbsp;McGann tells us, “is not the achievement of one’s desire: it is the shadow of that desire.”</li><li>We have only a “glancing bird’s eye view.”</li><li>The distance between our wish and our object is often so great because the forms and practices and procedures of creation in the digital medium remain profoundly unstable and speculative.</li><li>McGann’s premise might be restated: if you have produced what you thought you would, perhaps you’ve not created anything really; if a digital project becomes what was specified it might not be a digital humanities work.</li><li>How does scholarly practice change with digital humanities?<ul><li>Is an archive an argument? And a related question, where is our scholarship?</li></ul></li><li>How do we work differently?<ul><li>How do we work in teams of scholars in the humanities?</li></ul></li><li>A third question we face in digital humanities right now concerns the form of born digital scholarship.<ul><li>What does scholarly argument look like in digital form?</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>I was not aware of the unpredictability of a Digital Humanities project. This article fills me with motivation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While working on the 'Create Digital Humanities Project 2021 - 2022', I felt that I was facing a dead end. I also felt like I was behind and lost. I expected the work to flow a certain way. However, the path to completion felt like it was constantly changing; similar to the movie 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that I know how unpredictable a DH project can be, I can worry less when I feel like I have no idea what the final project is going to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, I feel like this article acts as a stress reliever for me.</p>

<p>What kinds of writing should humanities scholars who design software and make things in code be doing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Everybody working on a digital humanities project needs to be writing.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Purposeful design necessitates&nbsp;the creation of documentation at nearly every step.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>To have made something interesting in code you probably went through a reflective process that inevitably created a wake of valuable texts that were central to both the creation of the argument the code made, and potentially the most viable communication of that argument.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>At the end of a project, taking time to sit down and write out what you learned is an invaluable reflective practice.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Taking a few moments at the end of a project to reflect on what you wanted to accomplish, what actually happened, and what you learned from the process is critical not only for communicating results, but for really coming to know them.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Design and Humanities Research We are Still Only Beginning</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>People who make stuff have to write a lot about what they are doing as part of the process of making stuff.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Instead of contriving wonky experimental designs, it would be better for researchers to adopt the role of designer and think through how formalizing the iterative practice of design could serve as a basis for research methods.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The idea behind design-based research is that there is some kind of hybrid form of doing, theorizing, building and iterating that we should turn into a methodology.</li></ul>

<p>Before signing up for this internship, I was not aware that I would've needed to write this many reports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though writing was considered as one of my best skills, I've been having writer's block for about a year now. Knowing the number of reports and blogs I would need to write makes me feel overwhelmed. However, I think that forcing myself to write often would help me to get over this writer's block.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I noticed that the more I write, the better I get. I can express my thoughts better. To me, this is a great improvement and accomplishment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using the advice provided by the article, while I'm working on the project, I will jot down my thoughts and feelings about what I'm doing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, I feel hopeful about improving my writing and getting over writer's block.</p>

<p>I decided to write one reflection for these two since they are so similar. At first. I struggled with writing the reflection on these articles because it didn't seem like there was anything to reflect on. However, I noticed that there are many different types of projects and I realized that Digital Humanities is a diverse field of work. Digital Humanities can help us to achieve so many things; we just need to introduce it to more people and get them interested.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, there are multiple different tools that can be used to complete a project, and I feel like there is something for everyone to do.</p>
