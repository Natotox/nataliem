<p class="has-text-align-justify">I was not aware of the principles of learning in the digital age before reading this article. However, I had a general understanding of most of the rights concerning digital learning. I now have a better understanding of the aims that digital learning was created to achieve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that by learning in the digital age, a larger number of people have access to education and many more opportunities are being unlocked. I also believe that the bill of rights places a blanket of safety and comfort over learning digitally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since I am currently a student learning in the digital age, I have witnessed and experienced these principles and rights being practiced in my daily life. For example, Global Contribution: As students, we are allowed to share what we have learned and apply that knowledge in ways that can educate others. This also ties in with the right to be teachers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe that now that I know the principles of learning digitally, I will put more effort into implementing these in my daily life as a student.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, I feel grateful that I can utilize the technology available in this digital age to aid me in my educational advancement.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article made me think more deeply about big search and retrieval companies like Google, the code used to make their search engines, and the programmers who write the code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that there are a lot of controversial truths in this article that needs to be discussed more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I haven't noticed or observed any racist results when I search on the internet, which might've been due to my lack of awareness. Also, since casual racism is so normalized in this day and age, mostly seen in jokes or memes, I've gotten used to it and therefore I end up overlooking these details.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that I am aware of this information, I'll be more observant whilst searching on the internet so that I'll be able to report racist results and spread awareness on this topic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most impactful sentence in the article to me was the very first which stated: <em>"INFRASTRUCTURE IS CREATED by people and therefore embeds and reflects the values of the people who create it"</em>.</p>

<p>Honestly, before watching this video, I could not put together a suitable, specific definition of 'Digital Humanities'. I now have a better understanding of this term and can start piecing together this puzzle called 'Digital Humanities' in my mind, slowly getting closer to seeing and understanding the whole picture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe that as technology improves and advances, digital humanities would always be changing on a surface level, but will always have its core principles.</p>
